SCHRODINGER
===========

SCHRODINGER is a set of MATLAB files which provide moderately accurate numerical solutions of a number of standard problems familiar from many introductory texts on Quantum Mechanics. Orignially version is available on http://www.theophys.kth.se/mathphys/schrodinger.html

This repository is dedicated to its GUI improvements and algorithm updates since it's uploaded 1st August 1999.

I start with GUIDE and later I shall employ Java to customize Matlab GUI interface as suggested by Undocumented Matlab http://undocumentedmatlab.com/
